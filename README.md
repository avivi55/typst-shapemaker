# typst-shapemaker

A plugin for Typst, that uses a v1.1.0 of https://github.com/gwennlbh/shapemaker.
It just generates pretty images for title pages or whatever.

This project is mainly for personal use, it isn't clean AT ALL.

You can find an example in my personal school template : https://github.com/avivi55/typst_efrei_template
